datajson-builder
================

## Description

This Jekyll projects provides an easy to manage and fast method for generating a data.json file from YAML files.  

See [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) for more information on the [data.json schema](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/).

This project is only an `alpha` prototype and is not ready for production, yet.

## Installation

No installation is required to add new datasets or modify existing datasets.

If you want to decompile an existing data.json into YAML/Markdown posts, then you'll need to install NPM.  Installation instructions for a development build are below.

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo mkdir /var/www
sudo chown -R vagrant:vagrant /var/www
# Edit /etc/nginx/sites-availble/default to listen to :8000 and point to /var/www
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
###############
sudo su -
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm get stable
rvm list known
rvm install ruby-2.0.0-p353
rvm --default use ruby-2.0.0-p353
gem install jekyll
###############
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
cd ~/datajson-builder
npm install
sudo npm install -g gulp
###############
gulp
```

## Usage

The Jekyll template will automatically build the data.json file.  If not using GitHub pages, run `jekyll build` locally.

To decompile an existing data.json file, such as [http://state.gov/data.json](http://state.gov/data.json), run the following from the root directory:

```Shell
./decompile_datajson.js --dest DEST --file FILE
./decompile_datajson.js --dest DEST --url URL
```

For example:

```Shell
./decompile_datajson.js --dest '_posts/external' --file 'data.json'
./decompile_datajson.js --dest '_posts/external' --url 'http://state.gov/data.json'
```

If combining an external data.json and a locally managed data.json, it's a good idea to decompile the external data.json into a distinct folder, such as `_posts/external`.
