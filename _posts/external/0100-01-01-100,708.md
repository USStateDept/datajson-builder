description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 2 FAM 200 contains documentation of the following administrative components: - 210 Introduction - 220 Immunities of U.S. Representative and Establishments of Abroad - 230 Immunities and Liabilities of Foreign Representatives in the United States - 240 Customs Privileges Accorded U.S. Representatives Abroad - 250 Customs Privileges Accorded U.S. Foreign Representatives in the United States - 260 Tax Exemptions Accorded U.S. Representatives Abroad - 270 Tax Exemptions Accorded U.S. Foreign Representatives in the United States - 280 Claims Against the United States"
