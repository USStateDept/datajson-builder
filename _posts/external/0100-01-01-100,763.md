title: "PISA 2006"
describedBy: "http://pisa2006.acer.edu.au/downloads.php"
description: "The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) was created by the OECD member countries in 1997 to produce direct assessments of student performance, on a regular basis in an efficient, timely and cost-effective manner; and to provide more relevant and powerful indicators of human capital. PISA produces assessments of reading literacy, mathematical literacy, scientific literacy and a growing range of cross-curricular competencies among 15-year-olds in school. The dataset contains the anonymized records from the over 450,000 students in 65 countries who were sampled and took the PISA assessments. The records include background information about the students as well as their motivations and learning styles. Background information on the schools attended by the students including school level policies and practices is included in the dataset."
