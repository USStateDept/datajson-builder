description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 1 FAM 310-360 contains documentation pertaining to the following administrative components: - 310 Bureau of Legislative Affairs - 320 Bureau of Public Affairs - 330 Bureau of International Organization Affairs - 340 Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs - 350 Bureau of International Information Programs - 360 Office of Medical Services"
