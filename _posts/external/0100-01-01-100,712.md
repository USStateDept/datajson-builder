description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 2 FAM 600 contains documentation of the following administrative components: - 610 Elementary and Secondary Education Abroad - 620 Educational Facility Reporting Requirements - 630 Standard Provisions of the Award Under 22 U.S.C. 2701 (Section 29 of the Department Of State Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended by the Foreign Service Act of 1980) - 640 Standard Provisions of the Award Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as Amended - 650 Standard Provisions of the Award Under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act 0f 1961, as Amended"
