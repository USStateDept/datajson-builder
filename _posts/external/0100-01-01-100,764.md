title: "OECD Gender Data Portal 2013"
describedBy: "http://www.oecd.org/social/gender-development/"
description: "The OECD Gender Data Portal, www.oecd.org/gender/data, includes 40+ selected indicators shedding light on gender inequalities in education, employment and entrepreneurship. Data and metadata for all the indicators are easily and freely accessible and displayed through interactive visualizations. The Gender Data Portal is one of the main outputs of the OECD Gender Initiative, launched in 2010 to improve policies and promote gender equality in the economy in both OECD and non-OECD countries. The Portal is part of the new OECD Gender Equality website www.oecd.org/gender, which also features Closing the Gender Gap: Act Now, a publication that presents new analysis of the productivity losses caused by gender inequality and proposes policy solutions to close the gender gaps. While much progress has been accomplished in recent years, there are still relevant dimensions of gender inequalities that are poorly monitored and measured. The OECD Gender Portal is thus a work in progress, that aims at progressively filling these gaps through new indicators. The last data release, for Women's Day 2013, includes new gender-sensitive indicators of job quality, timely indicators of labor market participation, indicators on top and low-achieving students in different subjects and on entrepreneurial culture. The data cover OECD member countries, as well as Russia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa."
