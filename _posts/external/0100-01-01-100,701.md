description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 1 FAM 210-290 contains documentation pertaining to the following administrative components: - 210 Bureau of Administration (A) - 220 Bureau of Resource Management (RM) - 230 Bureau of Human Resources (HR) - 240 Office of the Legal Advisor (L) - 250 Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) - 260 Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) - 270 Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) - 280 Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) - 290 Foreign Service Institute (FSI)"
