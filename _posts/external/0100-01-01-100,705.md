description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 1 FAM 000-050 contains documentation of the following administrative components: - 010 Authority, Responsibilities, and Organization - 020 The Secretary of State (S) - 030 Office of the Deputy Secretary of State (D) - 040 The Under Secretaries of State - 050 Office of Inspector of General (OIG)"
