description: "The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandated a comprehensive revision to the operation of the Department of State and the personnel assigned to the US Foreign Service. As the statutory authority, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), details the Department of State's regulations and policies on its structure and operations. Currently, there are over 25,000 pages of policies and procedures published in 16 volumes of the FAM and 38 corresponding sections of the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH). Changes to the Department's organizational structure or the way it conducts U.S. Government business will usually trigger the need to update the FAM or FAHs. 2 FAM 1100 contains documentation of the following administrative components: - 1110 Directives - 1120 Publication in the Federal Register - 1130 Executive Orders, Proclamations, and Other Presidential Documents - 1140 Delegations of Authority - 1150 Forms Management - 1160 Information Collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) - 1180 Rulemaking"
